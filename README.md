# C++-Operation-Overloading
A C++ program that demonstrates the operation overloading capabilitites of the language. The main component of the program is the IntArray class. With this class, it's possible to declare integer arrays of any size with automatic index range checking. Instead of the fixed limits of 0 to SIZE-1, the lower and upper indexes can be any integer, negative or positive. Users can also add two arrays, assign full arrays to each other, compare two arrays for inequality and equality, and output arrays using the overloaded &lt;&lt; operator.

To change the tests used to demonstate the operation overloading in effect, edit the iadrv class file. The results of the tests are stored in the results.dat file for viewing.
