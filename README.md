# C-Operation-Overloading
A C++ program that demonstrates the operation overloading capabilitites of the language. The heart of this program is the IntArray class. With it, the user can declare integer arrays of any size with automatic range checking of indices. The upper and lower indices can be any integer, positive or negative, rather than the fixed limits of 0 to SIZE-1. It's also possible to assign entire arrays to each other, compare two arrays for equality and inequality, add two arrays, and output arrays using the overloaded &lt;&lt; operator.

To change the tests used to demonstate the operation overloading in effect, edit the iadrv class file. The results of the tests are stored in the results.dat file for viewing.
